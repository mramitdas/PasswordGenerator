# Password Generator

The most difficult part of managing multiple accounts is generating a different strong password for each. A strong password is a mix of alphabets, numbers, and alphanumeric characters. Therefore, the best use of Python could be building a project where you could generate random passwords for any of your accounts.

In order to create a strong password, users can use this password generator to generate a random and customized password.

## Steps required for building this project:
- All characters should be stored as a list. This can be done with the string module of Python or by typing each character individually.
- Ask the user for the length of the password.
- Use random.shuffle to shuffle the characters.
- Create an empty list to store the password.
- Iterate length times to generate the password.
- Choose a random character from all the characters using the random.choice method.
- Add the random character to the password.
- Randomize the resultant list of passwords.
- Use the join method to create a string from the list of passwords.
- Print the password.
